# FiveM-Loadouts-Master
Hello, today I am releasing my Loadouts script for use in FiveM. This script is fully customizable and will allow the user to add more loadouts if they so require. This is a simple LUA script that enables a user to carry out a command ingame and this will then spawn the guns for the loadout they require. This is currently set-up for UK Police however users may change it to whatever they desire by editing the WeaponLoadoutSpawn-c.lua file. Below is a Streamable video which explains all you need to know about the script and adding more functionality to it! https://streamable.com/d9dc89 ... For support within this script and any future ideas for releases,please join my Discord and open a ticket! https://discord.gg/PH5WAwwD
