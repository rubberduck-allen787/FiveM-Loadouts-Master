# FiveM-Loadouts-Master
Hello,Thank you for downloading my FiveM Loadouts script. Within this script, it includes code within LUA to make it easy for you to configure yourself!
To install please remove the -master at the end of the file name, add the WeaponsSpawn to the 'resources' folder within your Server-data. Then head to your server.cfg within Server Data and either 'start' or 'ensure' WeaponsSpawn

I hope you enjoy this release!
